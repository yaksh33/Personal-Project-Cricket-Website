        <h1>History Behind Cricket</h1>

        <body>

            <p>Cricket has been a huge sport in the current generation. England. It is said that adults around 1611 invented this game in Southeastern England. It was being played by adults, but it was described as a boys game. According to ICC, cricket has evolved from the game of bowls, with batsmen blocking the ball from the stumps, by swinging the bat and hitting it. There is no conclusive evidence of when runs were counted, how far the batsmen could hit, umpires or when wickets were introduced at both ends of the pitch. </p>
